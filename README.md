# Vegetable-Recognition-using-CNN
# Dataset
In the dataset there are 21000 images from 15 classes, where each class contains a total of 1400 images. Each class has an equal proportion and image resolution is 224Ã—224 and in *.jpg format. We split our dataset into three parts, where 70%(approx.) for training and 15%(approx.) for testing, and the rest 15%(approx.) for validation.
# Description
Using the open source deep learning framework , the improved CNN network model was used to train the vegetable image data set. The classification accuracy of the CNN network is improved due to the hyperparameter tuning and layer addition.
